## Tech Leaders Don't Consume What They Produce

**They build private systems while profiting from public manipulation:**

- **Mark Zuckerberg** - $270M Hawaii compound with private data systems
- **Jeff Bezos** - $42M Texas ranch with curated information infrastructure  
- **Elon Musk** - Multiple properties with independent networks
- **Peter Thiel** - $13.5M New Zealand retreat with private tech infrastructure
- **Sam Altman** - Private AI systems separate from public offerings
- **China's Tech Elite** - State-backed filtering for millions

**They don't scroll the feeds their algorithms create.** While they profit from attention manipulation, they protect their minds with carefully filtered, high-quality information. **The Vault gives you the same luxury.**
